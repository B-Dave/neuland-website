## 🎯 A Smarter Daily Overview: Meet the “Up Next” Card

One of the most loved features in this release is the all-new **“Up Next” card** - your real-time guide to the day.

It shows your current and upcoming lectures, live progress tracking, room information and timings. A clean, interactive layout makes it easy to navigate and understand.

The card also features **status dots**: dark green for completed lectures and gray for upcoming ones, giving you a quick visual summary of your schedule at a glance.

Early users are already loving the new experience - and this is just one of many enhancements in version 0.13.

## 🎓 Career Services & Student Counselling – Now in Your Pocket

Another major addition: **Career Service and Student Counselling events** are now fully integrated into Neuland Next.

You can now browse and register for workshops, info sessions, and more. View real-time availability of seats and skip the hassle of searching Moodle.

This is a big step toward making university life easier and more connected - all within the same app students already use daily.

## 💬 Built with Students in Mind

Neuland Next is an **unofficial companion app** built to support students at THI. While not developed by the university itself, it's widely used and appreciated for delivering practical tools tailored to student needs.

Thank you to everyone who's contributed feedback and helped shape this release - you drive our work forward.

Stay tuned for more updates and improvements in the future!
