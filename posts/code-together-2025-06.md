Our June code:together event was a great success! It was really nice to see so many people come together to work on projects, share ideas, and connect with fellow students and tech enthusiasts.

## More Than Just Coding

While the name might suggest it's all about writing code, code:together has become much more than that â€“ it's a community hub where ideas develop and people connect. Whether you came with a laptop to work on projects, design ideas to share, or just to enjoy some pizza and good conversation, there was something for everyone.

We keep these events pretty relaxed without strict schedules or forced activities. Instead, we create a space where collaboration happens naturally. Someone mentions a problem they're facing, and suddenly three people are brainstorming solutions. A designer shares a mockup, and developers start thinking about implementation possibilities. It's this spontaneous knowledge sharing that makes our community so special.

## Breaking Down Barriers

One nice aspect of this event was seeing how people from different backgrounds worked together so easily. We had international students joining local German students, and it was good to see how well they collaborated. Technology often serves as a common ground â€“ whether you're working with React, debugging Python, or discussing user interfaces, the shared interest in building things helps people connect regardless of language differences.

These connections help strengthen our community. International students bring different perspectives and approaches, while local students share knowledge about the regional tech scene. Everyone benefits from this exchange.

## Progress on Neuland Next

We also made good progress on the Neuland Next App during the evening. We fixed several bugs that had been on our to-do list, cleaned up some interface issues, and started working on some new features we're planning to release soon.

What made the development session work well was how naturally people collaborated. Experienced developers helped newcomers, designers gave feedback on interface changes, and users shared their thoughts directly with the development team. This kind of direct feedback is really valuable and something you don't always get in typical development work.

## Good Food, Good Conversations

Sharing pizza while working on projects always makes for a nice atmosphere. The food wasn't just about getting energy for coding â€“ it was a great opportunity for conversations. We talked about everything from the latest JavaScript frameworks to career plans, from project ideas to student life at THI.

These casual moments often lead to the best ideas. Someone mentions a user experience issue and it becomes a feature request. A discussion about design trends sparks ideas for interface improvements. It's good to see what happens when you bring together people who are curious and creative in a relaxed setting.

## Building Something Bigger

Events like code:together represent what Neuland Ingolstadt e.V. is about. We're a community that believes in collaboration, inclusivity, and what happens when people with similar interests come together to work on meaningful projects.

Every bit of code written, every design discussed, and every new connection made at these events contributes to building something larger than individual projects. We're creating a space where students and tech enthusiasts can learn, grow, and create together.

## What's Next?

The good momentum from this event is continuing into our next projects. The features we worked on are making their way into our development plans, the connections people made are turning into ongoing collaborations, and the positive energy is helping us plan future events.

If you missed this one, don't worry â€“ code:together is a regular event, and there's always room for new people and fresh ideas. Whether you're an experienced developer, interested in design, just starting out, or someone who enjoys being around creative people, you'll find your place in our community.

Keep an eye on our announcements for the next code:together event. We'd love to have you join us.

Let's keep building â€“ together. ðŸ’ª
