Our first Stammtisch in June was a perfect blend of community and tradition! Instead of our usual meeting spot, we headed to the local Volksfest in Ingolstadt for an evening that combined our tech community spirit with authentic Bavarian culture.

## Stammtisch – More Than Just a Meeting

For those who might not be familiar, our Stammtisch happens twice a month and serves as a relaxed gathering where members can connect outside of our more structured events. It's a chance to discuss everything from current projects to career opportunities, all in a casual atmosphere.

The name "Stammtisch" itself comes from the German tradition of a regular table where regulars meet – and that's exactly what we've created. Whether you're a long-time member or just getting to know our community, these gatherings are always welcoming and inclusive.

## Volksfest Vibes

The Ingolstadt Volksfest provided the perfect backdrop for our June meeting. The combination of traditional Bavarian atmosphere with our modern tech community created an interesting contrast that everyone enjoyed. We found a great spot where we could have conversations without the noise being overwhelming, and the festive atmosphere added a special energy to the evening.

Some members even showed up in traditional Tracht, which really added to the authentic Bavarian experience. The beer was flowing, the conversations were lively, and it was the perfect mix of local tradition and our international community spirit.

## Looking Forward

If you haven't joined us for a Stammtisch yet, we'd love to have you at our next one! These gatherings are open to every community member and everyone interested in our community, regardless of your technical background or experience level. It's all about connecting, sharing, and building something together.

Keep an eye on our announcements for the next Stammtisch – you never know where we might end up! ✨
