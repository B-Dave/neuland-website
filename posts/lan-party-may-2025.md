Our LAN Party on May 23-24, 2025, went really well! Organized together with Hochschulgaming Ingolstadt, the event brought together gaming enthusiasts and tech community members for a solid night of gaming and community building.

## Working Together

This was another good collaboration between Hochschulgaming Ingolstadt and Neuland Ingolstadt. The partnership worked well, with Hochschulgaming handling the gaming side and Neuland contributing community support and technical infrastructure. It's always nice to see student organizations working together like this.

The event took place at the Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt. From 3:00 PM on Friday to 3:00 AM on Saturday, the campus had a good gaming atmosphere with people bringing their setups and getting into various games.

## Gaming All Night Long

The 12-hour event had a good mix of gaming activities. People brought their own setups, which created a nice variety of systems and games. There was everything from competitive multiplayer games to more casual cooperative stuff.

The atmosphere was good - you had the usual LAN party sounds of keyboards and people getting excited about close matches. It was cool to see people who didn't know each other before teaming up and competing together.

## Community Building Through Gaming

The community aspect was probably the best part. People who might not have met otherwise came together over gaming and tech. Conversations went from game strategies to career stuff, from hardware to project ideas, pretty typical for our community events.

We had a good mix of people from serious gamers to casual players, from long-time community members to people just checking out our organizations. It was nice to see that kind of diversity and the networking that happened naturally.

## Technical Setup

The technical side went pretty smoothly, but we had to get creative with the network setup. The university's internet speeds are notoriously slow, so we set up our own caching servers to handle game downloads and updates. This was crucial for a smooth LAN party experience.

People brought their own equipment and the network held up well throughout the event. No major connectivity issues, which is always a relief at LAN parties. The caching servers really paid off â€“ everyone could download games and updates quickly without overwhelming the university's connection.

It's always good when the technical planning pays off and people can just focus on gaming.

## Food and Social Side

The event wasn't just gaming, we ordered pizza and had snacks available so people didn't have to worry about food. The breaks between gaming sessions were good for networking and casual conversations.

The atmosphere was pretty relaxed. No pressure to be the best player or have the most expensive setup, just people having fun and making connections over shared interests.

## Looking Forward

The positive feedback from this LAN party has motivated both organizations to plan more collaborative events. The turnout and community response were good, which shows there's demand for gaming-focused community events at THI.

For those who missed this one, don't worry, we host a LAN party every semester, so there will be another one soon. The turnout showed there's a good community of gamers and tech enthusiasts in Ingolstadt who want more events like this.

Thanks to everyone who participated, the organizers from both Hochschulgaming and Neuland, and THI for providing the venue. Events like this are what keep our community going.


See you at the next LAN party! ðŸŽ®
