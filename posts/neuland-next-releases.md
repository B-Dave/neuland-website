We’re excited to announce a fundamental change in how you can get Neuland Next on Android! With version 0.13.8, we’re breaking down barriers and making it easier than ever to install the app - no matter where you are, or how you want to get it.

## True Android Freedom: Download Your Way

Neuland Next has always been about empowering students. Now, we’re extending that philosophy to how you install the app:

- **Google Play Store**: The classic way - just search for Neuland Next and install with a tap.
- **Aurora Store**: Prefer privacy? Aurora Store is an open-source alternative to Google Play that lets you download apps without a Google account. Just search for Neuland Next and you’re set!
- **GitHub Releases**: Want maximum transparency? Grab the latest universal `.apk` directly from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/neuland-ingolstadt/neuland.app-native/releases) page. No middleman, just open source.

## Why We Love GitHub

GitHub isn’t just for code - it’s the backbone of our open-source journey!
We get free hosting and project management tools for our project, transparent APK build pipelines you can verify yourself, and now a reliable way to distribute the app directly to you.
No hidden steps, no paywalls, just pure open-source goodness. It’s all about trust, transparency, and empowering the community.

## Automatic Updates with Obtainium

Keeping your app up-to-date is now easier than ever. With [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium), a third-party open-source app, you can automate updates straight from GitHub Releases. Just add our repo link:

```
https://github.com/neuland-ingolstadt/neuland.app-native
```

Obtainium will fetch the latest releases for you - no Play Store required!

## Why This Matters

We believe in open source, transparency, and user choice. By supporting alternative stores and direct downloads, we’re making Neuland Next accessible to everyone:

- No Google account required
- Works on de-Googled and custom ROMs
- Maximum privacy and flexibility
- 100% open source, always

## How to Get Started

1. **Google Play**: [Install from Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.neuland)
2. **Aurora Store**: [Learn more about Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com/), then search for Neuland Next
3. **GitHub Releases**: [Download the latest .apk](https://github.com/neuland-ingolstadt/neuland.app-native/releases)
4. **Obtainium**: [Automate updates](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) with our repo link

## Why Not F-Droid (Yet)?

We love F-Droid and what it stands for! However, Neuland Next needs to communicate with the THI API, which requires embedding a (private) API key.
For compliance reasons, this key must remain private and cannot be exposed in public build pipelines.
Since F-Droid’s process is fully public and does not support build secrets, it’s not currently possible to distribute the app there without compromising this requirement.
If we find a secure solution in the future, we’ll be excited to bring Neuland Next to F-Droid too!

## Built by Students, for Students

Neuland Next is an open-source project driven by the student community. We’re proud to make the app as accessible as possible - on your terms.
