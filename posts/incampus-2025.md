The INCampus Festival 2025 was a complete success for Neuland Ingolstadt e.V.! Over two days, Friday and Saturday, in brilliant sunshine and 30 degrees, we presented ourselves to the broad public and showed what our community has to offer. It was a perfect opportunity to inspire not only students but also families and visitors from all over Ingolstadt for technology and innovation.

## A Festival of Possibilities

The INCampus Festival is the annual highlight of THI, where all organizations and student groups present themselves. For us, it was a great opportunity to show Neuland as an active and innovative community. Our booth was well-visited throughout both days, and the positive response exceeded all expectations.

What particularly pleased us: We reached not only students but also many families with children who were curious about what we had to offer. This shows that our approach of making technology accessible and experiential is exactly right.

## 3D Printing Live Experience

The absolute highlight of our booth were the two 3D printers that worked diligently throughout both days. In the 30-degree heat, we printed live small rubber ducks â€“ a perfect example of how modern technology works. Visitors were fascinated by how a real object emerges step by step from a digital model.

The 3D printers attracted not only technically interested visitors but also many children who watched in amazement as their favorite animals were created layer by layer. It was nice to see how technology connects generations and sparks enthusiasm for innovation.

## Magnetic Duck Fishing â€“ A Crowd Magnet

One of our most creative ideas was the magnetic duck fishing in the paddling pool. With magnetic rods, visitors could fish small plastic ducks out of the water â€“ a simple but very effective attraction that was particularly popular with families and children.

The paddling pool was crowded throughout both days, and the children's joy at successful catches was contagious. It showed that technology doesn't always have to be complicated to be exciting. Sometimes it's the simple, interactive elements that work best.

## Projects and Community in Focus

In addition to the interactive attractions, we also presented our current projects. The Neuland Next App was particularly well-received, many visitors were surprised that students had developed such a professional application. It was a good opportunity to show that we don't just work theoretically but develop practical solutions.

Conversations with visitors showed that many people are curious about our community. We were able to explain what Neuland is, how we work, and how anyone interested can get involved. It was nice to see barriers breaking down and people becoming interested in our work.

## A Day Full of Positive Energy

The weather played perfectly - over 30 degrees and brilliant sunshine created a cheerful atmosphere during the day when all the info booths were set up. Despite the heat, our 3D printers were reliable and visitors were patient. It was a day full of positive energy that showed how much joy it brings to share your passion with others.

The evening brought a completely different atmosphere with a huge party that transformed the area.
The festival truly had something for everyone - from educational experiences during the day to celebration and community building in the evening. Particularly impressive was the diversity of visitors: from small children who stood amazed in front of the 3D printers, to students interested in our projects, to families who simply wanted to spend a nice day on campus. It showed that technology and innovation can excite people of all ages.

## What's Next?

The success at the INCampus Festival motivates us to participate in similar events in the future. It was a valuable experience to present our community to a broader audience and show what we can achieve as a student initiative.

We look forward to maintaining the new contacts and perhaps seeing some of the interested visitors again at our next events. The festival has shown that Neuland is not just a student group but a community that connects people and promotes innovation.

A big thank you goes to all helpers and organizers who made this successful day possible. It was a perfect example of how much you can achieve when you work together and share your passion.

See you at the next INCampus Festival! ðŸ¦†âœ¨
